# Project on Operationalizing-Machine-Learning by Ebbin Daniel

This is an end-to-end machine learning project on Microsoft Azure where I have configured an **Automated Machine Learning Model** to run and select the best model and then to deploy and consume it. Based on the best model a pipeline was created to publish and run from a REST endpooint. 

**Dataset**

The <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing'>Bank Marketing Dataset</a> was used to train and test the AutoML models. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The marketing data consists of various attributes like age,job, education, etc to access if a bank term deposit for a client would be subscribed or not. 

Here we try to train our data on the attributes and we seek to Classify if a bank term deposit for a client would be subscribed or not.
